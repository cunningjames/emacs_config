This is just a basic Doom Emacs setup. Nothing special to see here, unless you like key chords. Love me some key chords.

I switched to Doom a while back to simplify my config and get a nice, works-out-of-the-box experience. My config is already growing more complicated, but I think it's in an okay place? Maybe? I'll probably keep playing with it.
